Summary:
To compare the similarity between the sequence, I set up a grading rule according to BLOSUM.
And, each different amino acid at same site will give 0 marks.
So, the result of the comparison is :
The similarity score between human and mouse sequence is  1490
The similarity score between human and random sequence is  -351
The similarity score between mouse and random sequence is  -348
The percentage of same amino acid between human and mouse is  0.9653979238754326
The percentage of same amino acid between human and random sequence is  0.02768166089965398
The percentage of same amino acid between mouse and random sequence is  0.031141868512110725
1.The biology meaning for the comparison is that 279 amino acid at the same site is the same in the given sequence of human and mouse.
While only 8 same amino acid sequence at same site between human and random sequence, and only 9 same amino acid sequence at same site between mouse and random sequence.
There is 96.5% similarity between the human and mouse protein sequence, while only 0.02% between human and random sequecne. Only 0.03% similarity between mouse and random sequence.

2. In envolution meanings, this result indicates that human and mouse are highly similar in the given protein, meaning that they 
probably have same ancestors. This is not resulted from random effect because the similarity score between random sequence to mouse and human are all very close to 0.
