I like programing.
Though there's always bugs and errors.
Each time you do something, 
Remember to git add.
When I look back to the first few days when I learned biomedical informatics,
I remembered I was almost confused about everything.
But now, I can work with difficult calculations,
working with data using numpy and pyplot.
I realize that nothing is absolutely uncomprehensive,
as long as keep learning.
